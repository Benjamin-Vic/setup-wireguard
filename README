# README — WireGuard (Docker) + SSH via docker0

## 1) Start WireGuard

In the folder with your `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 2) SSH to the host through the tunnel

```bash
ssh <user>@172.17.0.1
```

### Find the host IP on Docker’s bridge

```bash
ip -4 addr show docker0 | awk '/inet /{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
# typically: 172.17.0.1
```
> Note: Your WireGuard peer must allow the Docker subnet (e.g., `AllowedIPs = 10.13.13.1, 172.16.0.0/12`) to reach `docker0`.
